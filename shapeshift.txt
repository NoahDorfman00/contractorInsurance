  <content>#### How soon will I start losing weight?

As soon as you start following the workout and nutrition plan, you will start getting results! Losing 5-10 lbs the first month is not uncommon, but it comes with consistency.

#### Do you have any type of guarantee?

If you listen to everything I say, hit your workouts, and follow my nutrition protocols and are still unable to accomplish the goal you and I agree to; then there is 100% money back guarantee.

#### What does you program teach?

ShapeShift’s RESHAPE program teaches you how to lose fat, build muscle and reclaim your confidence and energy through a PERMANENT identity transformation.

Not by letting go of carbs, but letting go of who you USED TO BE! Reshape your life, reshape your body, reshape your metabolism, reshape your energy, reshape yourself! I prioritize education so that after this program you can be your own coach, and coach yourself and your friends. I tell people this is the LAST program you will ever need and I stand by that. I pride myself on being the BEST fitness program for permanent transformation on the planet.

#### How is this different from all the other workout programs I have already tried?

The RESHAPE program focuses on IDENTITY change to create permanent transformation. While every other program will have you follow some cookie cutter program like a dog, never teaching you the skills you need to be successful on your own. The RESHAPE program thrives from its 3 core principles:

1) Sustainability (AKA FUN). Cause what is FUN is REPEATED.

2) Personalization. Everything will be custom to you, your life, your job, and your preferences.

3) Accountability. We offer top level accountability to ensure sure that you stay on track with your goals despite what life throws your way

#### Will I get the support I need when my body stops changing?

Yes, I do weekly check-ins to avoid weight loss plateaus. The reason why most people fail at fitness programs is because they buy a random, non-personalized program online and it comes without a coach. This makes it very hard to get past plateaus because the program never changes. Your program will change along with your body to make sure we’re continuously making progress.

#### Do I need a gym or can I train from home?

Both work fine! If you have equipment at home I can make you a custom workout routine to fit your schedule and exercise capability.

#### Will I get a step-by-step roadmap even if I am just getting back into shape?

Yes, after you sign up, we will walk you through everything you need to do to make sure we can start getting results as fast as possible. After you watch your welcome video, have orientation, and receive all your plans there is a step-by-step process every client follows to get started that completely takes the guesswork out of getting back in shape.

#### Is it really possible to lose any weight if I am over 40 and have 3+ kids?

Yes, we work with many people who are 40 and older who are still creating incredible transformations with kids and a busy schedule. You will be receiving many different tools and pieces of advice to help manage your time efficiently.

#### How do I know if I am ready to join your program? I feel like I am way too busy with my work and kids. I hardly have time to shower

There is never going to be a “best time to start”. If you learn how to conquer your fitness goals when your life is busy, they become EASY to maintain when your life becomes less busy. If you use the busy excuse forever, you will pass away with poor health. The choice is yours.

#### Can I pay you after I lose the weight?

I used to think like this too. But it wouldn’t do you any favors. It wouldn’t be fair to YOU. People who pay..pay attention and cause you to have some skin in the game to drive you to make the most out of the program. The program works and that has been proven time and time again. Now, we need to put in the work.

#### I have hired other ‘online fitness coaches’ and didn't get results. How do I know this will work?

I am sorry to hear that. You are not alone though. I did the same thing when I first started out and the best thing I can encourage you to do is check out our testimonials.

The testimonials prove that we care a lot about who we work with and they are real people. Most fitness coaches never spend time improving their service to give their clients a better experience. We are very happy to say that we have added an app, a members site, cookbooks, and an incredible client group that supports one another to help you on your journey.

Our mission is to eliminate yo-yo dieting for good and prevent people from taking drastic approaches, which cause them to end up quitting or excessive weight regain. We are only going to get there by providing the best service possible to each individual client.

#### I can't afford this program. Anything you can do for me If I really want to start?

We offer different financing options to help split up payments and make things flexible for you! We also offer 100% money back guarantee so there is practically no risk.

#### Do you believe in rapid fat loss or slow and steady?

Both. Depending on genetics you will lose weight at different paces. One thing that holds true is; that people can usually lose weight a lot faster, but they never end up doing it because they follow unsustainable approaches that cause a 3-month transformation to end up being a 6-9 month of yo-yo crash diet. Wasting money and time. You will never have to worry about that again in the RESHAPE program. It’s a change for LIFE.

#### I am just coming back from injury. Can you still help me?

Yes! If you are working with a physical therapist we can include the workouts they want you doing with the workouts I will make them for you to make sure you are progressively getting better and better. I have had many clients go through this process with me because accountability and nutrition are one of the most important things when recovering from an injury. This is because your injury may have made you less active, making weight gain easier. BY controlling nutrition and supporting you, I am able to keep that from happening. 

#### Do I need to be ready to train 2 hours a day and 6 days a week?

No.

Our best clients only workout 3-5 times a week and complete three workouts in 45-90 minutes MAX. Our workout app has a stopwatch and timer built into it so it helps you stay accountable and not waste time in the gym so you can get back to your normal daily tasks.

#### How long does your program last?

There is a 6 month and 12 month option. Anything less is too little and anything more is just if you love the community and want to stay.

#### Is there a discount if you pay in full?

Yes, there is a discount IF paid in full.

#### I’m scared to invest.

You should be. This is normal and actually a sign that you’re getting out of your comfort zone. Congratulations! I have also personally invested tons into my own coaching and self-development and even still do today.

[It](http://today.it/)’s what makes me my best self. I would never ask someone to do something I haven’t done myself. We can both agree that nothing grows inside your comfort zone. Getting out of it is always a little uncomfortable but always more than worth it. I have graduated clients who say they would have invested double looking back. You cannot put a price tag on your health, and my programs are more affordable than your future medical bills from bad health.

When I first went to hire a coach, I was scared too. That is because I didn’t believe in myself. I believe in coaching. I was scared I was going to be their problem. As soon as I looked in the mirror and my pain for remaining the same or getting worse outweighed my fear of joining, I took the leap and I NEVER looked back. That coach changed my life.

We have a saying around here that goes; “Good health is like insurance, you can’t afford NOT to have it”.</content>

A lot of people assume trainers/coaches have it figured out, that they don't go through the struggles and the pains that a lot of their clients face. For me, that couldn't be further from the truth.

I've been through the pains and struggles of being overweight and dealing with the mental and physical battles that come with it. I've also experienced the complete other side of the spectrum due to developing a very unhealthy relationship with food, which led me to lose extremes amounts of weight, most of it being muscle.

It wasn't until I decided to hire a coach of my own where I learned to take control of my life and get educated on proper exercise, nutrition, and mindset that I started to make strides in my health.

This is the driving force behind why I started ShapeShift Coaching, to create a space where people, no matter their starting point in their fitness journey, can find the support and guidance they need to overcome their own struggles and become LEADERS in their own circles and inspire all of those around them to be healthy as well.</content>

#### **As a coach, I have walked the walk. I have radically changed my life first so that we may do the same for YOU. Welcome to ShapeShift Coaching, where my biggest focus is PERMANENT TRANSFORMATION. You will not need any other coach or program after completing the RESHAPE course. You can be your own coach or even coach your friends! I pride myself on teaching YOU everything you need to know about being FIT for LIFE. You will know every “secret” other programs have been hiding from you to keep you a customer for life. Your hamster wheel of getting in and out of shape ends right here, right now.**

#### **Apply for a free consultation to get started today.**

#### **What do you have to lose?**

#### Why people struggle to stay in shape.

People struggle with 3 main things when it comes to successfully getting and STAYING in shape. 

1) **Strategy**: Having the right strategy for YOU, your body, and your schedule is critical for reducing frustration along your journey. 

2) **Mindset**: Ultimately most people’s issues. People stand in their own way. This is what having a team of coaches is for, to replace your old, ineffective mindset with a fresh, productive one that is aligned with your goals and WHO you want to be/create for yourself. Remember; the biggest change you make will be your IDENTITY. Self-sabotage is REAL and we will eliminate that here for you. 

3) **Accountability**: Leave your ego at the door! If you want to go fast, do it yourself. If you want to go fast AND far and make sure the results LAST, get a mentor! Just like your parents held you accountable to shower and brush your teeth as a child, we will do the same for your health, so that it becomes a HABIT, just like your hygiene :). Bonus, proper fitness coaching is FUN and personalized to you, ultimately making it...

4) **SUSTAINABLE** for life.

#### Why FIT people succeed in life and lead a healthy lifestyle.

Some of you probably are thinking, “Who gives a shit what I look like or how I eat.” 

To answer that question, first, you have to find out what is important to You.

Do you want to be MORE successful at work?

Do you want to be MORE Energetic? 

Do you want to spend MORE time with your loved ones?

Do you want to feel MORE Confident?

If you answered “YES” to ANY of these, becoming “fit” is going to drastically enhance your life. 

Getting in shape isn’t only for the physical appearance but for your own personal well-being mentally and physically. People who are in shape and have CONTROL of their body: Have MORE Energy. Are MORE Productive. Are MORE Successful. So if you’re ready to kick your old habits to the curb, strap on your seatbelt let’s get this shit going. It’s time RIGHT NOW to step into the life you deserve. 

#### Why joining ShapeShift WILL be the best decision of your life.

Joining ShapeShift means much more than joining another diet and exercise plan. I strive to TEACH every last client to the point where at the end of their program they can teach others the same principles they learned. 

I'm not just some coach that tells you what to eat and show you how to workout, I am a coach who has experienced these roadblocks for myself and developed countless strategies that create success. So if you’re looking to LEARN and commit 110% to change your life, leave your bullshit, and start really showing yourself what you’re made of, well, you’ve come to the right place. My clients WIN.

BUT First WATCH THIS!

#### What does you program teach?

ShapeShift’s RESHAPE program teaches you how to lose fat, build muscle and reclaim your confidence and energy through a PERMANENT identity transformation.

Not by letting go of carbs, but letting go of who you USED TO BE! Reshape your life, reshape your body, reshape your metabolism, reshape your energy, reshape yourself! I prioritize education so that after this program you can be your own coach, and coach yourself and your friends. I tell people this is the LAST program you will ever need and I stand by that. I pride myself on being the BEST fitness program for permanent transformation on the planet.

#### How is this different from all the other workout programs I have already tried?

The RESHAPE program focuses on IDENTITY change to create permanent transformation. While every other program will have you follow some cookie cutter program like a dog, never teaching you the skills you need to be successful on your own. The RESHAPE program thrives from its 3 core principles:

1) Sustainability (AKA FUN). Cause what is FUN is REPEATED.

2) Personalization. Everything will be custom to you, your life, your job, and your preferences.

3) Accountability. We offer top level accountability to ensure sure that you stay on track with your goals despite what life throws your way

#### Will I get the support I need when my body stops changing?

Yes, I do weekly check-ins to avoid weight loss plateaus. The reason why most people fail at fitness programs is because they buy a random, non-personalized program online and it comes without a coach. This makes it very hard to get past plateaus because the program never changes. Your program will change along with your body to make sure we’re continuously making progress.

#### Do I need a gym or can I train from home?

Both work fine! If you have equipment at home I can make you a custom workout routine to fit your schedule and exercise capability.

#### Will I get a step-by-step roadmap even if I am just getting back into shape?

Yes, after you sign up, we will walk you through everything you need to do to make sure we can start getting results as fast as possible. After you watch your welcome video, have orientation, and receive all your plans there is a step-by-step process every client follows to get started that completely takes the guesswork out of getting back in shape.

#### Is it really possible to lose any weight if I am over 40 and have 3+ kids?

Yes, we work with many people who are 40 and older who are still creating incredible transformations with kids and a busy schedule. You will be receiving many different tools and pieces of advice to help manage your time efficiently.

#### How do I know if I am ready to join your program? I feel like I am way too busy with my work and kids. I hardly have time to shower

There is never going to be a “best time to start”. If you learn how to conquer your fitness goals when your life is busy, they become EASY to maintain when your life becomes less busy. If you use the busy excuse forever, you will pass away with poor health. The choice is yours.

#### Can I pay you after I lose the weight?

I used to think like this too. But it wouldn’t do you any favors. It wouldn’t be fair to YOU. People who pay..pay attention and cause you to have some skin in the game to drive you to make the most out of the program. The program works and that has been proven time and time again. Now, we need to put in the work.

#### I have hired other ‘online fitness coaches’ and didn't get results. How do I know this will work?

I am sorry to hear that. You are not alone though. I did the same thing when I first started out and the best thing I can encourage you to do is check out our testimonials.

The testimonials prove that we care a lot about who we work with and they are real people. Most fitness coaches never spend time improving their service to give their clients a better experience. We are very happy to say that we have added an app, a members site, cookbooks, and an incredible client group that supports one another to help you on your journey.

Our mission is to eliminate yo-yo dieting for good and prevent people from taking drastic approaches, which cause them to end up quitting or excessive weight regain. We are only going to get there by providing the best service possible to each individual client.

#### I can't afford this program. Anything you can do for me If I really want to start?

We offer different financing options to help split up payments and make things flexible for you! We also offer 100% money back guarantee so there is practically no risk.

#### Do you believe in rapid fat loss or slow and steady?

Both. Depending on genetics you will lose weight at different paces. One thing that holds true is; that people can usually lose weight a lot faster, but they never end up doing it because they follow unsustainable approaches that cause a 3-month transformation to end up being a 6-9 month of yo-yo crash diet. Wasting money and time. You will never have to worry about that again in the RESHAPE program. It’s a change for LIFE.

#### I am just coming back from injury. Can you still help me?

Yes! If you are working with a physical therapist we can include the workouts they want you doing with the workouts I will make them for you to make sure you are progressively getting better and better. I have had many clients go through this process with me because accountability and nutrition are one of the most important things when recovering from an injury. This is because your injury may have made you less active, making weight gain easier. BY controlling nutrition and supporting you, I am able to keep that from happening. 

#### Do I need to be ready to train 2 hours a day and 6 days a week?

No.

Our best clients only workout 3-5 times a week and complete three workouts in 45-90 minutes MAX. Our workout app has a stopwatch and timer built into it so it helps you stay accountable and not waste time in the gym so you can get back to your normal daily tasks.

#### How long does your program last?

There is a 6 month and 12 month option. Anything less is too little and anything more is just if you love the community and want to stay.

#### Is there a discount if you pay in full?

Yes, there is a discount IF paid in full.

#### I’m scared to invest.

You should be. This is normal and actually a sign that you’re getting out of your comfort zone. Congratulations! I have also personally invested tons into my own coaching and self-development and even still do today.

[It](http://today.it/)’s what makes me my best self. I would never ask someone to do something I haven’t done myself. We can both agree that nothing grows inside your comfort zone. Getting out of it is always a little uncomfortable but always more than worth it. I have graduated clients who say they would have invested double looking back. You cannot put a price tag on your health, and my programs are more affordable than your future medical bills from bad health.

When I first went to hire a coach, I was scared too. That is because I didn’t believe in myself. I believe in coaching. I was scared I was going to be their problem. As soon as I looked in the mirror and my pain for remaining the same or getting worse outweighed my fear of joining, I took the leap and I NEVER looked back. That coach changed my life.

[Here](http://life.here/)’s a promise though, I will give you all the tools and support you need to succeed because I’ve felt your pain, and I’ve been in your shoes. You will never need another coach after me, you’re worth it. It’s time to get uncomfortable and change your life. We have a saying around here that goes; “Good health is like insurance, you can’t afford NOT to have it”.</content>
