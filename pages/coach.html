                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p>A lot of people assume trainers/coaches have it figured out, that they don't go through the struggles
                    and the pains that a lot of their clients face. For me, that couldn't be further from the truth.</p>

                <p>I've been through the pains and struggles of being overweight and dealing with the mental and
                    physical battles that come with it. I've also experienced the complete other side of the spectrum
                    due to developing a very unhealthy relationship with food, which led me to lose extremes amounts of
                    weight, most of it being muscle.</p>

                <p>It wasn't until I decided to hire a coach of my own where I learned to take control of my life and
                    get educated on proper exercise, nutrition, and mindset that I started to make strides in my health.

                <p>This is the driving force behind why I started ShapeShift Coaching, to create a space where people,
                    no matter their starting point in their fitness journey, can find the support and guidance they need
                    to overcome their own struggles and become LEADERS in their own circles and inspire all of those
                    around them to be healthy as well.</p>
