                    <p>The RESHAPE program focuses on IDENTITY change to create permanent transformation. While every
                        other program will have you follow some cookie cutter program like a dog, never teaching you the
                        skills you need to be successful on your own. The RESHAPE program thrives from its 3 core
                        principles:</p>
                    <p>1) Sustainability (AKA FUN). Cause what is FUN is REPEATED.</p>
                    <p>2) Personalization. Everything will be custom to you, your life, your job, and your preferences.
                    </p>
                    <p>3) Accountability. We offer top level accountability to ensure sure that you stay on track with
                        your goals despite what life throws your way</p>

                    <p>ShapeShift's RESHAPE program teaches you how to lose fat, build muscle and reclaim your
                        confidence and energy through a PERMANENT identity transformation.</p>
                    <p>Not by letting go of carbs, but letting go of who you USED TO BE! Reshape your life, reshape your
                        body, reshape your metabolism, reshape your energy, reshape yourself! I prioritize education so
                        that after this program you can be your own coach, and coach yourself and your friends. I tell
                        people this is the LAST program you will ever need and I stand by that. I pride myself on being
                        the BEST fitness program for permanent transformation on the planet.</p>

                    <p>Yes, I do weekly check-ins to avoid weight loss plateaus. The reason why most people fail at
                        fitness programs is because they buy a random, non-personalized program online and it comes
                        without a coach. This makes it very hard to get past plateaus because the program never changes.
                        Your program will change along with your body to make sure we're continuously making progress.

                    <p>I am sorry to hear that. You are not alone though. I did the same thing when I first started out
                        and the best thing I can encourage you to do is check out our testimonials. The testimonials
                        prove that we care a lot about who we work with and they are real people. Most fitness coaches
                        never spend time improving their service to give their clients a better experience. We are very
                        happy to say that we have added an app, a members site, cookbooks, and an incredible client
                        group that supports one another to help you on your journey.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to eliminate yo-yo dieting for good and prevent people from taking drastic
                        approaches, which cause them to end up quitting or excessive weight regain. We are only going to
                        get there by providing the best service possible to each individual client.</p>

                    <p>Both. Depending on genetics you will lose weight at different paces. One thing that holds true
                        is; that people can usually lose weight a lot faster, but they never end up doing it because
                        they follow unsustainable approaches that cause a 3-month transformation to end up being a 6-9
                        month of yo-yo crash diet. Wasting money and time. You will never have to worry about that again
                        in the RESHAPE program. It's a change for LIFE.</p>

                    <p>Yes! If you are working with a physical therapist we can include the workouts they want you doing
                        with the workouts I will make them for you to make sure you are progressively getting better and
                        better. I have had many clients go through this process with me because accountability and
                        nutrition are one of the most important things when recovering from an injury. This is because
                        your injury may have made you less active, making weight gain easier. BY controlling nutrition
                        and supporting you, I am able to keep that from happening.</p>
